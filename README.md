Welcome to ILCT! 
This is a web application for a neighborhood resource center that provides services for the immigrant and refugee community that lives in Milwaukee Wisconsin. 

A visitor to the site may read about who we are, what services we supply and ways to get involved.  
Students preparing to take the naturalization exam can study the 100 questions and download a copy of them.  
Students can also enhance their English language skills by watching ESL YouTube videos.  
Someone interested in learning more about the center can use the contact page to write an email to request more information.

A volunteer can register and create an account, once they do this they can enter their availability and what they would like to be involved in.  
They can also view their schedule and sign up for events.

An admin can view all volunteer information, student information and can create and edit the schedule for the week. 
They can also add events and view who has signed up to attend them.
